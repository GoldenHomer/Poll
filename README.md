Real-time poll in the MEAN stack. Trying to determine why this works locally but not when deployed to the web. 

Having trouble deploying to Heroku and I do not know why. If you want to do see what this does and you have node installed, you can do it locally using:

*npm install

and then

*npm start.

You won't have to run Mongo since I have MongoLab handling the database. Port is at 3000.

Thanks Mr. Lennon and IBM for this great tutorial: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-nodejs-polling-app/.
